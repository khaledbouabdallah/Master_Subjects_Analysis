Subjects were proposed by teachers so that master students can choose one as their subject.

- Year: 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years.
- University: Ferhat Abbas Setif 1.
- Faculty: Faculty of Science.  
- Department: Computer Science.

The dashboard can answer some following questions, among other things:
- What is the most proposed subject?
- What is the most prioritized specialty in our department?
- What is Percentage of affected/unaffected topics?
- Is there a big difference between 2022 and 2023 subjects?
- what kind of subjects that specific teacher likes to propose?
